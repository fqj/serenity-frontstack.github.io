## Introduction
AngularJS is a complete JavaScript-based open-source client web application framework mainly maintained by Google and a community (individuals and corporations) to address many of the challenges encountered in developing single-page applications. It aims to simplify both the development and the testing of such applications by providing a framework for client-side model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–view model (MVVM) architectures, along with components commonly used in rich Internet applications.

According to JavaScript analytics service [Libscore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libscore), AngularJS is used on the websites of Wolfram Alpha, NBC, Walgreens, Intel, Sprint, ABC News, and approximately 8,400 other sites out of 1 million tested in July 2015 [http://libscore.com/?#angular](http://libscore.com/?#angular)

Following, we will describe different consideration to have in mind, the best parts, the bad and the ugly ones, prior to take the decision to use AngularJS as a frontEnd framework.

## 1. The Good Part
__Angular Enables Single Page Apps:__ Single Page Applications are becoming more popular. More functionality is being moved to the web, providing an experience that feels almost like a native app in the web. By rendering on the client they cut down load on the server as well as reduce network traffic. Angular doesn't force you into building SPA apps; it only provides plenty of built-in support simplifying the process.

__Code organization and Modularity:__ Angular excels with its clear separation of modules, templates, controllers, services, directives and filters, combined with an Angular module like code organization, it is possible to cleanly divide up an app into different features small and self-contained. This modularity allows building large-scale apps with big development teams individually owning a piece, and also allows a sustainable evolution and easy testing.

__Functionality first thinking:__  AngularJS force to think directly in the functionality to build, and then you build it! In contrast with other frameworks where structure, DOM modification and other practices are not clearly delimited. These, allows to have good conversations around design of the app up-front, before coding starts.

__Productivity:__ Tooling in Angular - whether for testing (Karma, Protractor, Jasmine), Build (grunt, gulp), Workflow (yeoman, bower) and other tasks have been highly tested and improved, what makes it really productive, It just simply works. In other hand, the data-binding feature, filters and directives allow to manipulate the data on the view level abstracting from the business logic. As a result, developers writes less code to achieve the task, great deal to optimize productivity.

__Community and Support:__ The quality and quantity of modules [popular AngularJS resources](http://ngmodules.org/), added to an extensive community support in the form of free and high quality tutorials, makes Angular a really good choice.

## 2. The Bad Part
__Hard to learn:__ Even though there are a lot of material and courses to develop the skills around Angular, it is more complex to perfect these abilities than other framework, especially at the beginning but the learning curve doesn’t improve along the way in the improvement process. It is a highly Opinionated Framework. Very productive in common and controlled feature developments with a very efficient syntax proposal, but it could become complex and unproductive in special cases such as Non-RESTful services usual with third party system integrations where a lot of hacks will be expected.

__Slow performance in complex and highly demanding systems:__  The development productivity is high especially in initial and prototyping stages with a good user experience.  When the application gets more complex with every feature integration, performance could be affected without a careful design.  Angular main pieces such us double binding logic could become ineffective due to binding cycles and watcher overload where the digest phase could become a nightmare. There are different technics to overcome this that we will cover in [our style guide](https://gitlab.ci.gsnet.corp/groups/frontstack-angular/angular-styleguide).

__SEO:__  One pitfall to using AngularJS like other JavaScript client render frameworks is Search Engine Optimization (SEO) because the produced apps are hard to crawl by Google. (There are tools like [prerender.io](http://prerender.io/) that could help to improve google positioning).

__Limited reusability:__ Components, libraries and directives developed in Angular can be used easily among other Angular applications due to its proprietary dependency injection, but it prevents it reusability in other projects with different framework approaches such us Ember, Backbone, Polymer, React, etc.
It looks like Angular team has taken this matter very seriously, and the integration with standard components such us Web Components or Polymer elements will be more natural in the next versions.

__AngularJS is heavier:__ in contrast with other frameworks, Angular core libraries are considerably heavier. It could be mitigated with bundle and compressions techniques which slightly complicate the development and continuous integration process.

## 3. The Ugly Part

Soon the next major version of the framework will come out, which __breaks backward compatibility__.
Even though a new Release Candidate version has been recently announced, [currently in RC4](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), it will take several months until the new Angular2 version is ready for production. FrontStack-team will approach this new framework in a near future as well as will provide best-practices to migrate Angular 1.x applications to Angular 2.

## 4. Conclusions

![conclusions](/images/why_when.png)

Angular JS has its good and bad parts but the framework needs to be chosen for a certain type of project. Angular is a heavy robust framework, if you desire a light-weight fast loading application, maybe Angular JS it is not the best option, there are some other light-weight frameworks that can fulfil the job. On the other hand, if you need an application with huge data process, multidevice, based in services like security, logging…etc Angular is the framework to work with.
After listing and explaining the points that make Angular as unique as it is, you can now decide in which cases Angular JS can play the good, and in which it will play the bad.

If you finally decide to go for with AngularJS Framework, from FrontStack we encourage to take a look to our [Angular Basic Starter Kit](https://gitlab.ci.gsnet.corp/frontstack-angular/angular-basic), a good starting point to approach the next frontend project, ready to evolve into a more complete and complex corporative application.
