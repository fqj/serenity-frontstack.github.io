# Example of API documentation in angular-basic:

## Introduction
Our Angular basic provides an integrated solution for auto builds our api documentation.

## 1. How is built?
We are using ngdocs for write the API documentation. The gulp-ngdocs module builds our documentation and generates a html webpage, then we serve it using browsersync.

## 2. Standard supported jsdoc directives
The ngdoc utility has basic support for many of the standard jsdoc directives. But in particular it is interested in the following directives:

- __@name name__: the name of the ngdoc document
- __@param {type} name description__: describes a parameter of a function
- __@returns {type} description__: describes what a function returns
- __@requires__: normally indicates that a JavaScript module is required; in an Angular service it is used to describe what other services this service relies on
- __@property__: describes a property of an object
- __@description__: used to provide a description of a component in markdown
- __@link__: specifies a link to a URL or a type in the API reference. _NOTE_: to link to ng.$rootScope.Scope#$on insert methods_ between # and the actual method name: {@link ng.$rootScope.Scope#methods_$on listen}. Same goes for properties and events.
- __@example__: specifies an example that will be formatted as a code block
- __@deprecated__: specifies that the following code is deprecated and should not be used
- __@this__: specifies what this refers to in the context of a documented function

The type must be wrapped in {} curly braces; e.g. {Object|Array} Parameters can be made optional by putting the [name] in square brackets; e.g. @param {boolean} [ownPropsOnly=false] Descriptions can contain markdown formatting

## 3. AngularJS specific ngdoc directives

- __@ngdoc__:specifies the type of thing being documented. See below for more detail.
- __@scope__:specifies that the documented directive will create a new scope
- __@priority__:specifies the documented directive's priority
- __@animations__:specifies the animations that the documented directive supports
- __@restrict__:specifies how directives should be shown in the usage section. For example, for [E]lement, [A]ttribute, and [C]lass, use @restrict ECA
- __@methodOf type__:links a method to the object/service where it is defined
- __@propertyOf type__:links a property to the object/service where it is defined
- __@eventOf type__:links a method to the object/service where it is defined
- __@eventType emit|broadcast__:specifies whether the event is emitted or broadcast

## 4. Now gulp-ngdocs supports .components()

In addition to controllers, services, direcives... now support components thanks to Serenity Frontstack fork of gulp-ngdocs available here [gulp-nodocs](https://github.com/Serenity-fronstack/gulp-ngdocs)

components example:

```
* @ngdoc component
* @name app.component:guideItem
*
* @description
* This component shows cards using the item binding for his own building.
*
* @param {object}  item      A object with card data
```

## 5. Conclusion
Our angular basic project provides an useful environment which permits you keep focused and don't waste time in other tasks like API documentation.

By the other hand, document your project is a good practice for his future maintanibility.
