# Angular 4
![](/images/angular4announcement.png)

Angular 4 has been a shocking advertisement for everyone. We just witnessed the arrival of Angular 2 last year, 
after releases each week, to the point where it is now: Angular 2.4.X. 
Angular has announced a new version policy, a new versions planning and a stabilization on his
named versions, but also announced big releases every 6 months with clear breaking changes that will deprecate
previous versions (with deprecation pashes). A very different movement to what Polymer or ReactJS proposes for the moment.

## Why Angular 4? What happens with Angular 3?
The main reason is that image:

@angular/router package is guilty of the new Angu lar name because his version is 3.x.x, that differs of the real version of angular. 
Angular team just wants to give consistency of named to his packages and advance the named 4.x.x of all its versions.

Currently Angular has version 2.4.x, and according to SEMVER, the only thing that is announcing a greater release of Angular.
This new version 4.x.x will realease on March 2017.

# What implications
* 1. Backwards Compatible with Angular 2
* 2. Is only an update of Angular2, but with breaking changes.

From the official post:
> Changing from version 2 to version 4, 5, … won’t be like changing from Angular 1. It won’t be a complete rewrite, it will simply be a change in some core libraries that demand a major SEMVER version change. Also, there will be proper deprecation phases to allow developers to adjust their code.

# Angular RoadMap
* New **major** release each 6 months. (Breaking changes)
* New **minor** release each 3 months.
* New **patch** release each week.

The calendar would look like this:

# Predictable, Transparent & Incremental Evolution

# Conclusion

New updates mean a framework more active.
But the most important part, means a new major release each 6 months involves fix breaking changes with deprecation phases. We'll have to maintain and adapt our code to be updated.
