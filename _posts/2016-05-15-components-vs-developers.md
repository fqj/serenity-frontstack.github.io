A new Angular oddisey?
----------------------


AngularJs 1.5 introduces a new player called .component() which allow us build directives in a more intuitive way, adding new syntax to make element directives easier. Why I’m talking about directives? Because, .component() it’s just a sugar syntax for directives, and should be familiar with the use of them.

Create directives in old versions is not very intuitive, and this is the main purpose of .component().

 

Ok, ok, what has changed?
-------------------------

The new .component() method changes the way of thinking when we are
building an application. As you know, in Angular you can build with
controllers, directives, … etc. But now, all our application is a
component with subcomponents. Think in components as little lego pieces
where all of them combined are a complex component.

Sounds good, but all of them are reusable?
------------------------------------------

The reusability grade of a component depends of each component and how
was built. The word known as “component” is very ambiguous because when
we talk about components we think in untouchable pieces that we can
share in all our projects, and this is a partial true. All depends of
how we encapsulate them and how we make them independents.

 

Write less
----------

When we make the exercise of cut up our application in components, we
are saving time in a short term. We are simplifying our building
process, and the most important we are reusing our own code in the
entire application. Of course, as I say above, the grade of reusability
of a component depends of how is built. In conclusion,It is a simple way
to share it and use it in other projects.

**Don’t reinvent the wheel!**
